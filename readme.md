<h3>LEGO SPIKE Design Workshop</h3><p>LEGO SPIKE is a fun robotic framework that allows students to explore coding and design concepts. In this class, we will start at the very beginning of coding concepts and engineering…gradually increasing the complexity of lessons and projects. Design and build motorized machines, catapults, pyramids, demolition derby cars, truss and suspension bridges, buildings, and other constructions. Explore concepts in physics, mechanical engineering, structural engineering, and architecture while playing with your favorite creations. This is a hands-on and minds-on class suitable for LEGO® novices to “maniacs.” This class is not affiliated with the LEGO Group. This is also a course for young students, who wish to understand the basics of software engineering and design through the lens of LEGO. Students do not require familiarity with LEGO, but a little is helpful. Students will be required to use a mouse and keyboard, typical of 20th century PC computers. The ability to listen, type on a keyboard, solve problems, and have fun is required for this class.</p>
